/*  This program are not currently available for wifi bunny. It seems to be more suitable for normal badusb devices that need to be flashed with a payload. I will make a version suitable for wifi bunny within this month.  */

Compile and upload functions in this program depend on arduino-cli (https://github.com/arduino/arduino-cli)
If you are using windows, download arduino-cli.exe and put it in the same directory with D2A.py
If you are using linux or MacOS, please download the source code and compile it by yourself, then put the compiled binary file together with D2A.py.

Run the following command under powershell/shell:
./arduino-cli board attach arduino:avr:leonardo

Then the program can work properly.
